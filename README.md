## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project is the need of a solid starting point for a workspace that can have everything setup from the start and be able to scale with more complexity (adding more packages...etc). The setup is heavily inspired by the [t3-stack](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) with regards to typesafe environment variables, next-auth and tRPC setup. While the t3 stack is amazing for small to medium sized projects. I felt the need for more, mainly testing, nx cache and storybook which is why this boilerplate has come to be.
